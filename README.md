---

## Installation

Probably needs Go v1.9 or newer.

```bash
go install github.com/natsukagami/mpd-mpris/cmd/mpd-mpris
```

Install scripts coming soon.

## Running

```
# mpd-mpris --help
  -host string
    	The MPD host (default localhost)
  -instance-name string
    	Set the MPRIS's interface as 'org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.mpd.{instance-name}'
  -interval duration
    	How often to update the current song position. Set to 0 to never update the current song position. (default 1s)
  -network string
    	The network used to dial to the mpd server. Check https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial for available values (most common are "tcp" and "unix") (default "tcp")
  -no-instance
    	Set the MPRIS's interface as 'org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.mpd' instead of 'org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.mpd.instance#'
  -port int
    	The MPD port. Only works if network is "tcp". If you use anything else, you should put the port inside addr yourself. (default 6600)
  -pwd string
    	The MPD connection password. Leave empty for none.
  -pwd-file string
    	Path to the file containing the mpd server password.
